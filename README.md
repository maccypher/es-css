# es:CSS
## essential CSS framework

This framework is inspired by iKreativ - Workless. I don't wanna present just another clone/fork of "Workless". That's why I built it from scratch, took some of the concepts from iKreativ, adopted some of the techniques and spiced it up with some own knowledge.

# To Do:
### Lots of conceptual work left ...

* bring concept of basic folder structure to an end
* figure out the essentially needed files
* keep basic files as generic as possible
* create a simple design with extrem usability

### Release v0.1

* initial commit
